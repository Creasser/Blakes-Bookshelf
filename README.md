# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Digital Bookcase

This web application allows users to keep a digital version of their bookcase. Users are able to add books to the bookcase through a controlled form component. Each book in the collection has its own personal page that displays additional data. 
<br />
This application uses react.js to create the frontend. useState, useEffect, and react-router-dom were used to assist in the frontend developement of this project. It utilizes react-router-dom to implement client side routing to the applicaition and create a single page application. 
The backend of the applicaiton is mocked by json-server with a db.json file.
